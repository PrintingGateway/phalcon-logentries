```

Create the composer.json file as follows:

    }
}
```

## Tests

Phosphorum use [Codeception][6] unit test.

First you need to re-generate base classes for all suites:

```bash

```

Execute all test with `run` command:

$ vendor/bin/codecept run
# OR
$ vendor/bin/codecept run --debug # Detailed output
```
